Simple example how to deal with the U-Boot scripts. Use existing script for flashing loaders to eMMC boot partition 1
as an example.

1. Use the following command to add an image header to script:
   sudo mkimage -A arm64 -T script -C none -n 'Demo Script File' -d flash_loaders.txt flash_loaders.img
2. Load script to desired memory address (example uses tftp to download script, but it can be stored elsewhere):
   tftp 0x76000000 flash_loaders.img
3. Run script:
   source 0x76000000
